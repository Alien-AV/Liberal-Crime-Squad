===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Alien-AV/Liberal-Crime-Squad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Alien-AV/Liberal-Crime-Squad)

On Febuary 4, 1974, the Symbionese Liberation Army, an American self-styled
urban gurrilla warfare group kidnapped 19-year-old media heiress Patricia Hearst
as she and her 26-year-old boyfriend, Steven Weed, sat relaxing in their
Berkeley, California home....

Liberal Crime Squad is a satirical ASCII-style political role-playing/strategy
game in which you recruit a team of Elite Liberal radicals and try to save the
United States from a descent into Arch-Conservatism.  Gameplay is based loosely
on the classic 1983 RPG Oubliette.

This Fork
---------

This fork aims to merge the best features from most advanced existing forks (Currently forks of bregma and king-drake on GitHub), and do some bugfixing, and minimal refactoring.
Refactoring scope is planned to be limited to the areas that require change, for preparation to the change itself, so-called Boy Scout Principle.

Building From Source
--------------------

Currently autotools build, adding cmake build is in progress.
